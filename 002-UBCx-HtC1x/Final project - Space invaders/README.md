Language: Racket

The tank moves right and left at the bottom of the screen when you press the arrow keys. If you press the left arrow key, it will continue to move left at a constant speed until you press the right arrow key.

The tank fires missiles straight up from its current position when you press the space bar.

The invaders appear randomly along the top of the screen and move at a 45 degree angle. When they hit a wall they bounce off and continue at a 45 degree angle in the other direction.

When an invader reaches the bottom of the screen, the game is over.
