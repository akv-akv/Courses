# CS50 Finance
This is a stock-trader app made as part of Harvard's CS50 Fall 2017 class.
Problem set specifications here: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/tracks/web/finance/

This app allows a user to look up a stock quote, "buy" and "sell" stocks with a virtual currency, keep track of their stock portfolio's value over time, and see a history of their transactions.
